- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaptainFuzzyFace
- 👀 My primary interest is in sustainability throughh repair and reuse. As a software developer I've always preferred to find code that someone else has already written and modify it to suit my specific purpose. Partly because I'm lazy, partly because I think that two heads are better than one when building any solution and partly because I think it's quicker. I use the same mentality with my workshop stuff, especially any tools I'm using. Find an old tool and over time modify it to suit my purposes. This may have come from growing up with Lego as my primary toy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for work but I'm a great fan of Raspberry Pis and so it's my plan to develop some stuff using those too. Something open sourse, of course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that benefits the repair community. I currently help run Repair Cafes in Rugby and Coventry and I'd like to use my technical skills to improve how repair helps with sustainability.
